Employed MATLABâ€™s ode45 and ode15s solver to solve simultaneous differential equations for multiple species in complex reaction systems.
Tabulate and plot the temperature and molar flow rates of different species as a function of catalyst weight.
Heterogeneous Data Analysis: Developed an algebraic rate law consistent with experimental data, analyzed to extract key parameters (e.g., k, KA) by linear regression, identified a mechanism with the rate-limiting step, and designed a catalytic reactor to achieve specified conversion targets.
